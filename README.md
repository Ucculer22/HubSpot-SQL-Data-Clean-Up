# HubSpot-SQL-Data-Clean-Up
Microsoft SQL Code that helped me clean-up contact information for import into HubSpot.
HubSpot CRM is pretty annoying to use when it comes to cleaning up contact information. Most of the time you have to export
a csv file, make changes in Excel, and then import back in. 

That being said, when dealing with larger data sets where contacts were bought from a vendor and are not verified, it's hard to 
validate with Excel alone. Organizations can have +1,000 employees so SQL is a great tool to modify large quantities of data
and find discrepencies throught out.

This code was used on a smaller data set of about +300 contacts as a test run and later was used for a data set of +50
companies with over 5000 employees.
